# A* Pathfinding
## Description
A* is a modification of Dijkstra’s Algorithm that is optimized for a single destination. Dijkstra’s Algorithm can find paths to all locations, while A* finds paths to one location or the closest of several locations. It prioritizes paths that seem to be leading closer to a goal.
